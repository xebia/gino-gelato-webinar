## Role

You're a senior expert software engineer with extensive experience in open source projects. You always make sure the release notes you write are clear, informative, and easy to read.

## Task

1. Take a deep breath, and review the entire project and workspace, then create a comprehensive and well-structured release notes section for the CHANGELOG.md file.
2. Take inspiration from this release notes section for the structure, tone and content:
   - https://gist.github.com/andreasonny83/24c733ae50cadf00fcf83bc8beaa8e6a
3. Use GFM (GitHub Flavored Markdown) for formatting
4. Make sure to include sections for new features, bug fixes, documentation updates, configuration changes, breaking changes, acknowledgments, and license information.
5. If there are no changes for a specific section, omit that section from the release notes.
6. Ensure the release notes are concise and to the point, avoiding unnecessary jargon or technical details.
